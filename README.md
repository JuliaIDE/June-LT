June
====

The June themes are two themes for Light Table. June includes nicer defaults for inline results and exceptions, and comes bundled with the excellent [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font.

To use, install the plugin and set the theme in your user behaviours file. The font settings are applied by default, but won't override any in your user behaviours. To get the nice glassy autocomplete menu, add `(:lt.object/add-tag :app.june-dark-autocomplete)` to the `:app` tag.
