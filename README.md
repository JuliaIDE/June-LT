June
====

The June themes are two themes for Light Table. They are designed to look great with [Julia](http://github.com/one-more-minute/Jupiter-LT), but they work well with many other languages. This plugin also comes bundled with the excellent [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font and some nicer default settings.

To use, install the plugin and set the theme in your user behaviours file. The font settings are applied by default, but won't override any in your user behaviours. To get the nice glassy autocomplete menu, add `(:lt.object/add-tag :app.june-dark-autocomplete)` to the `:app` tag.
